# Airline Fare Prediction
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable.
The objective of the project is to automate the predictions of Airline ticket fares with the help of machine learning algorithms. Worked on the Airline Ticket dataset from Kaggle to perform Feature engineering and feature extraction and applying various ML models to automate the predictions of Airline ticket fare. Also validated the model using various statistical analysis methods and visualize it using matplotlib and seaborn. And finally performed Hyperparameter Tuning to get the best cross-validation score using Randomized Search CV
